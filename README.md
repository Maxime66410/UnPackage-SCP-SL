Unpackage Unity SCP: Secret Laboratory

My goal is to do a thorough search in the files of SCP: SL.

Something difficult to do.

But not at all impossible, the games created under Unity OR Unreal Engine have no protection, alas it is easy to hack to find a lot of stuff in the game files.

# Unity version : Unity 2019.3.0f or Unity 2017.3.0f3
